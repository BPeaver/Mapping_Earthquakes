# Mapping Earthquakes

Utilizing current (past 7 days) data from the USGS regarding earthquake data, this program allows the user to apply or remove several layers of information to the world map. 

Included are both street view, satelitte view, and "dark" layers for the background map itself
Data layers include all earthquakes, major earthquakes (magnitude 4.5 and higher), and an outline of tectonic plates to show fault lines
